The FLAG file is hidden somewhere in the filesystem. Could you please find it for me?

Implement find_the_key() function to find the regular file named FLAG and
and dump its content to stanard output (descriptor 1).
The file is placed somewhere inside `/usr/share/tree` directory.

The prototype for your implemented function should be `void find_the_key()`

Note: you have to include all the required header files by yourself.

Please paste your codes below, and
use a single line containing only '//EOF' (without quotes) to submit your codes.
