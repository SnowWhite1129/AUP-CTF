The FLAG file is storead in /home/orw/FLAG. Could you please read it out for me?

Implement orw() function to read the flag and and dump its content to stanard output (descriptor 1).

The prototype for your implemented function should be `void orw()`

Note: you have to include all the required header files by yourself.

Please paste your codes below, and
use a single line containing only '//EOF' (without quotes) to submit your codes.
